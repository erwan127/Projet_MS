  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "station002",
    "position": {"x": 50, "y": 60},
    "capaciteGlobale": 3
  }'
```

### Step 3: Create Vehicles
```bash
# Tesla Model 3
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/vehicules \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "vehicle001",
    "marque": "Tesla",
    "modele": "Model 3",
    "nombrePlaces": 4,
    "etat": "OPERATIONNEL_EN_STATION",
    "niveauCharge": 85
  }'

# BMW i3
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/vehicules \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{

    "marque": "BMW",
    "modele": "i3",
    "nombrePlaces": 4,
    "etat": "OPERATIONNEL_EN_STATION",
    "niveauCharge": 92
  }'
```

### Step 4: Assign Vehicles to Stations
```bash
# Place vehicles at Downtown Station
curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/stations/station001/vehicles/vehicle001/add
curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/stations/station001/vehicles/vehicle002/add
```

## üìä Postman Collection

Import the provided Postman collection: `New Collection.postman_collection.json`

Key Test Sequences:
1. Health Checks - Verify all services are running
2. Data Population - Create users, stations, vehicles
3. Basic CRUD Operations - Test create, read, update, delete
4. Rental Workflows - Complete rental simulation
5. Statistics Testing - Various statistics endpoints

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If Services Don't Start:
```bash
# Check Java version (should be 17)
java -version

# Stop all services and restart
./stop-services.sh
./start-services.sh

# Check logs
tail -f logs/station-service.log
```

### If APIs Return Empty Data:
```bash
# Check if databases are connected
./check-status.sh

# Manually populate using the commands above
./populate_test_data.sh
```

---

## üìù Expected Results

After Population:
- 2+ Stations with different capacities
- 2+ Vehicles distributed across stations
- 2+ Active Users with valid credentials
- Statistics showing real-time system metrics

Working Features:
- ‚úÖ Service Discovery via Eureka
- ‚úÖ API Gateway routing
- ‚úÖ CRUD operations for all entities
- ‚úÖ Vehicle rental workflows
- ‚úÖ Real-time statistics collection
- ‚úÖ Database persistence
- ‚úÖ Cross-service communication

## üéØ Evaluation Points

This project demonstrates:
1. Microservices Architecture - Independent, loosely coupled services
2. Service Discovery - Eureka for service registration/discovery  
3. API Gateway - Single entry point with routing
4. Data Persistence - MySQL databases with JPA/Hibernate
5. Inter-Service Communication - REST APIs and Feign clients
6. Business Logic - Vehicle rental domain implementation
7. Monitoring - Statistics collection and aggregation
8. Error Handling - Graceful error responses
9. Configuration Management - Environment-specific configs
10. Testing - Comprehensive API testing suite

**Note:** This testing guide provides all necessary commands for a comprehensive evaluation of the microservices application.
